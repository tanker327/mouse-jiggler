# Mouse Jiggler

A simple Python script that simulates human mouse movement during work hours to prevent screen locks and "away" status.

## Features

- Small random mouse movements (Â±50 pixels)
- Random intervals between movements (3-7 minutes)
- Configurable work schedule for each day of the week
- Only runs during defined work hours
- Logs movement times and distances

## Requirements

```bash
pip install pyautogui
```


## Configuration

The script can be configured by modifying these variables at the top of the file:

- `MIN_SLEEP_MINUTES`: Minimum time between movements (default: 3 minutes)
- `MAX_SLEEP_MINUTES`: Maximum time between movements (default: 7 minutes) 
- `MAX_MOVEMENT_PIXELS`: Maximum distance mouse will move in any direction (default: 50 pixels)
- `WORK_SCHEDULE`: Dictionary defining work hours for each day
  - Keys are weekday numbers (0-6, Monday-Sunday)
  - Values are tuples of (start_hour, end_hour) in 24h format
  - Use `None` for off days
  
Example schedule:


```python
WORK_SCHEDULE = {
    0: (9, 17),  # Monday: 9 AM - 5 PM
    1: (9, 17),  # Tuesday
    # ...
}
```

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```
